description: I am an incoming graduate student at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca) going to pursue a Masters degree in Computer Science with a focus on Computer Vision. I have obtained versatile experience in Computer Vision and NLP through both research and industry roles. Previously, I was an ML SDE at LimeChat, boosting sales for D2C market leaders and automating their customer support using level 3 AI chatbots. I graduated from NIT Trichy - one of the top ten engineering collges in India with a Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering. Through my undergraduate years, I was fortunate to have the able guidanace of bright minds such as [Prof. Liming Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/limingchen/accueil), [Prof. CV Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/), [Prof. Vinay Namboodiri](https://vinaypn.github.io/). I am grateful for receiving the [Charpak Lab Scholarship](https://www.inde.campusfrance.org/charpak-lab-scholarship) which enabled me to pursue a research internship in France and the [SPDC scholarship](https://mea.gov.in/spdc.htm) which funded part of my undergraduate education. 
I was an active member of the [Content Team](https://medium.com/@TeamContent_Festember/about) at Festember, NIT Trichy's annual cultural festival, where I contributed to blog articles and newsletters. I love travel and will take every chance I get. Here are some pictures from when I toured Europe in Summer 2019.
